# anti-sleep-alarm-system
A driver drowsiness detection system using ESP32, OpenCV, seat sensors, and steering detection.
This project is a prototype safety system designed to detect drowsiness in drivers using eye-tracking, posture detection, and steering activity monitoring.

## ðŸš— Features
- **Eye Detection**: Real-time drowsiness detection using OpenCV with a laptop camera.
- **Posture Monitoring**: Seat sensors check if the driver is leaning or slouching.
- **Steering Detection**: A potentiometer is used to monitor inactivity in steering.
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Used for sensor input and alert control.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python (OpenCV)
- PyCharm for development
- ESP32 (Arduino or MicroPython)
- Seat Pressure Sensor
- Potentiometer
- Serial Communication (USB)
